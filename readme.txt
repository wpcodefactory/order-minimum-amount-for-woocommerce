As the eCommerce landscape advances, establishing distinct order prerequisites, including setting minimum and maximum bounds, as well as numerous other conditions like weight and volume, becomes imperative, underscoring the necessity for a more refined tool.

Our plugin excels in this domain, providing a comprehensive command over **minimum/maximum limits** and various order conditions for your WooCommerce setup, all embedded within a simple, intuitive interface.

Accommodating a variety of order metrics, the plugin empowers you to enforce constraints whether they relate to **order total, product quantity, or specific dimensional parameters**, delivering a broad application spectrum.

Whether your goal is to enforce specialized limits, numeric prerequisites, or enforce particular conditions for your customers’ orders, our tool has been professionally crafted to fulfill such demands, while concurrently enhancing the entire purchasing process.

**Before delving deeper into our plugin features, here is what to expect:**

* **Expansive Order Limit Management:** Customize minimum and maximum order requirements based on total, quantity, and various physical measurements (e.g., weight, volume, length), along with limitations based on categories and tags, ensuring optimal control especially for bulk purchases or specific order specifications.

* **Multi-Dimensional Capability:** Activate various conditions concurrently, such as min/max order total, quantity, and various physical dimensions, ensuring all aspects of an order comply with established parameters.

* **Tailored Customer Messaging:** Offer customizable messages to customers on cart and checkout pages, enhancing communication and clarity throughout their purchasing journey.

* **Inclusive/Exclusive Calculation Options:** Decide if you want to include or exclude elements like taxes, shipping, discounts, and/or fees when calculating the total order sum, providing unmatched control over order validation.

* **User Role-Specific Conditions:** Choose to apply diverse order conditions based on user roles, enabling a full approach to order management.

* **Checkout Page Management:** Optionally restrict access to the checkout page for customers when amount prerequisites are not fulfilled, preventing "surprises" for your customers a bit late.

* **Advanced Maximum Amount Controls:** For maximum limits, choose to validate amounts immediately upon adding to cart, or alternatively, entirely conceal the “add to cart” button for products when amounts surpass the defined limits.
